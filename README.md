# WordSearchKata

A word search solver. Given a properly formatted text file as input, output the locations of the given words.

## Running

`swift run`

## Testing

To run the tests make sure you are in the root directory

`swift test`

- Note: While Swift is cross-platform, testing with XCTest behaves differently when running on linux since there is no ObjectiveC runtime. Therefore, in order to save time tests can only be run where the ObjectiveC runtime is present. For more information please visit [XCTest on Linux](https://oleb.net/blog/2017/03/keeping-xctest-in-sync/)
